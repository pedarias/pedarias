<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Pedro.</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a MSc Student in CS from Brazil</h3>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Machine Learning Specialization**. This course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at my repositories
